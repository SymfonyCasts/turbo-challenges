preview:
  question: |
    Hey! I've prepared this template that needs NO preview from Turbo when it loads:
    
    ```twig
    {% extends 'base.html.twig' %}
    
    {% block title%}Play Pong in the Browser for Free!{% endblock %}
    
    {% block metas %}
    
    {% endblock %}
    
    {% block body %}
    <div id="pong_game_app"></div>
    {% endblock %}
    ```
    
    I even added a `block metas` so that I can add the proper `head` tag to avoid this... but,
    I can't seem to remember exactly how this is!
    
    What is the actual `meta` tag that we need to add to stop turbo previews?
  explanation: |
    You can also set this meta to contain the value `no-cache` which means that it won't generate
    any previews at all (not even for the back button!)

    Other metas that we can leverage with turbo are:
    
    ```twig
    <meta name="turbo-visit-control" content="reload">
    ```
    
    To enforce a complete reload every time turbo visits this page. Check the Turbo Drive reference
    for more information on these!
