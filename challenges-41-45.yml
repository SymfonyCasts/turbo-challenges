  question: |
    What are Turbo Streams NOT used for?
  explanation: |
    Turbo Streams are used to update parts of the page without having to necesarily perform
    a request.

    They are very usefull for applications that have to update constantly to events that
    aren't always generated by the user, like chat applications.

turbo_stream_2:
  question: |
    I'm building a chat application and the main chat template is located at
    `chat/index.stream.html.twig`.

    How should I render this template from a Symfony controller?
  explanation: |
    The response object `TurboStreamResponse()` is what makes the response special
    so that Turbo can handle it the right way in the Browser!
