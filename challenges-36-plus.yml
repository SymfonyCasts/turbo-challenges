    Which of these properties do *not* come in the `fetchResponse` object
    when the event `turbo:before-fetch-response` happens?
  explanation: |
    Feel free to explore the `fetchResponse` object in your browser console.
    It contains many useful properties for you to make your Turbo applications
    really powerful!

          response, such as `body`, `headers` `status`, `redirected`
          and more.
        b: |
          `location`: Is an object that contains the information about the
          location where the response came from.
        c: |
          `language`: Is a string containing the language in which our content
          was retrieved.

          successful.
      correct: c

  question: |
    In our video, why do we have to add `Turbo.clearCache();` to our
    `turbo:before-fetch-response` event handler?
  explanation: |
    `Turbo.clearCache()` is useful when we need to make absolutely
    sure that, from that moment forward, our pages need to load fresh
    *without* a cache.

      choices:
        a: |
          Because by doing `event.preventDefault();` in the line
          before, we're preventing Turbo from clearing its cache
          after a form successfully submitted.
        b: |
          Because we need to make sure that after our form submits,
          the pages will load from scratch so that they show the
          reflected changes (Turbo does not do this on its own)
        c: |
          Because it's always a good practice to clear the Turbo
          cache before we call `Turbo.visit()` so that we always
          get a fresh page.
        d: |
          Because Turbo has a bug when some times it doesn't properly
          clear the cache after a form was successfully submitted.
      correct: a
