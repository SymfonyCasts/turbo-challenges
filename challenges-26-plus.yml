frame_loading:
  question: |
    Our site has a sidebar that takes forever to load, so our project
    manager wanted us to extract it into a lazy Turbo Frame.
    
    Now he wants us to show a loading indicator whenever we are
    loading its contents! Here's the loading code:
    
    ```html
    <turbo-frame id="app_sidebar">
        {% include('templates/_busySidebar.html.twig') %}
    
        <span class="frame-loading-show fas fa-spinner fa-spin">
        </span>
    </turbo-frame>
    ```
    
    How can I show and hide this spinner *only* when the turbo frame
    is busy?
  explanation: |
    Whenever Turbo Frames is fetching HTML into a frame, it will add
    a `busy` attribute to its `<turbo-frame>` element. This is useful
    for us to add all kinds of effects to it while loading!

          It's not possible to achieve this with *only* css. You would
          have to hook events in a stimulus controller and add/remove
          the classes when users click on a link to navigate within
          the frame.
